const handleSelectionChange = (selectedOption) => {

console.log(`Selected option: ${selectedOption}`);

// Your custom logic here

};

return (

options={options}

defaultValue="Option 1"

onChange={handleSelectionChange}

wrapperClass="custom-wrapper-class"

/>

);

};

export default MyComponent; ```

## Explanation

options: An array of strings representing the options in the dropdown.

defaultValue: The default selected option when the component is rendered.

onChange: A callback function that will be called when an option is selected. It receives the selected option as an argument.

wrapperClass: Additional CSS classes for styling the select wrapper.

## Features

Dropdown Visibility: The dropdown can be toggled open or closed by clicking on the select box.

Option Selection: Options can be selected by clicking on them, and the selected option is displayed in the select box.

Keyboard Navigation: Users can navigate through options using the keyboard arrow keys (Up, Down), open/close the dropdown (Enter, Space), and close the dropdown (Escape).

Styling: The component provides basic styling, and additional styling can be applied using the wrapperClass prop.

## Notes

Make sure to handle the onChange callback function to capture the selected option and perform any necessary actions in your application.

Customize the appearance by providing your own styles or overriding the default styles.

Ensure that the nice-select.css file is imported to apply the default styling.

Now you're ready to integrate the NiceSelect component into your React application and enhance the user experience for dropdown selections.
